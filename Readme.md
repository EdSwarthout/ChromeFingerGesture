## Use Gemini Pro Canvas to build a Chrome Extension

## **Project Goal**

The primary goal is to develop a Chrome extension that allows users to scroll up and down a webpage using specific finger gestures captured through their webcam. The gestures, as observed in the video, involve holding up an index finger and moving it up or down to control the scroll direction.
